#+TITLE: Arbiter

* Overview

	Arbiter is a command line tool for remotely controlling a docker swarm, with additional functionality for deploying stacks described by a =docker-compose.yaml= as well as the corresponding data directory to go with the stack, using [[https://github.com/jnterry/treeploy][treeploy]].

* Connecting to Remote Systems

	In order to work a manager in the swarm must be setup to accept SSH connections for a user in the docker group (or the root user). Arbiter can then establish a connection to the remote host using =arbiter connect username@hostname=.
